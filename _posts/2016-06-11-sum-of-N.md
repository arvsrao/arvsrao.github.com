Lately I've been thinking about the content of my high school mathematics courses. In Runyun's college algebra and trigonmetry class we were introduced to proofs by induction--of all things--somewhere towards the end of my junior year. An important proof technique, for sure. However, the combinatorial expressions they were applied to, like the sum of first $N$ natural numbers, seemed miraculous. Proof by induction is fairly straight forward. But how does one even guess at a closed formula for such expressions? I remember Runyun saying something to the effect "you need to be smart". I suppose so, but we can actually construct the closed form of the sum of the first $N$ natural numbers.

First recall the closed formula:

$$
\begin{equation*}
    f(N) = 1 + 2 + \cdots + N-1 + N = \frac{N(N+1)}{2} \\
\end{equation*}
$$

Rearranging the sum doesn't change the value of the expression so $ 2 \times f(N)$ can also
be written

$$
\begin{array}[c]{}
             &  1  & + & 2  & + & \cdots & + & N-1 & + & N \\
   \Large{+} &  N & + & N-1 & + & \cdots & + & 2   & + & 1 \\
   \hline
             &  N+1 & + & N+1  & + & \cdots & + & N+1 & + & N+1
\end{array}
$$

Above $f(N)$ is added to itself, however the second instance of $f(N)$ is written as a sum in reverse 
order. The $N$ intermediate (or column) sums are all $N+1$. Therefore, 

$$
\begin{gather*}
	2 \times f(N) = N(N+1) \quad \Longrightarrow \quad f(N) = \binom{N+1}{2}.
\end{gather*}
$$
