I'm a mathematician / software engineer / runner living in San Francisco. I work @Riviera Partners as a Data Scientist. Here's my <a href="http://www.rao.im/files/resume_for_web.pdf">resume</a>. 

A mathematician by training, specifically in differential geometry and geometric analysis, I have broad interests that span pure and applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science. Particularly, machine learning; topics in computer science, like computational geometry, and numerical methods for solving PDEs; quantitative finance and stochastic PDE; and more...This blog is an attempt to record my musings on these and other topics. 

I love discussions, so please don't hesitate to drop me a line. Your message will be sent directly to my e-mail, and I’ll write back to you as quickly as possible. 

Thanks for reading!
