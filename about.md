I'm a mathematician / software engineer [@HERE][1].

A mathematician by training, specifically in differential geometry and geometric analysis, I have broad interests that span pure and applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science. In particular, topics related to graphics/computational geometry and computational topology; MIMO wireless system design and associated detection/estimation methods; quantitative finance and stochasticÂ PDE; and more...This blog is an attempt to record my musings on these and other topics. 

I love discussions, so please don't hesitate to connect [@6sphere][2] or <span style="font-size:18px;font-family:american typewriter"> {first name} **at** {last name}.im</span>. And should you wish to keep your correspondence private, my [public key][3].

Thanks for reading!
