I'm a mathematician / software engineer / runner living in San Francisco. I work [@RiviTeam][1] as a Data Scientist. Here's my [resume][2].

A mathematician by training, specifically in differential geometry and geometric analysis, I have broad interests that span pure and applied mathematics, electrical engineering, and computer science. Particularly, machine learning; topics in computer science, like computational geometry, and numerical methods for solving PDEs; quantitative finance and stochasticÂ PDE; and more...This blog is an attempt to record my musings on these and other topics. 

I love discussions, so please don't hesitate to connect. 

Thanks for reading!
